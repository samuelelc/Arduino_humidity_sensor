# DHT11 humidity sensor

For this arduino project I used a ``DHT-11 Sensor`` and an ``OLED display 128x64 pixel i2c``

The repository contains three .ino files for three versions of the project 

<br>

### First version 
It prints on display the humidity percentage and cartesian graph
### Second version
It prints on the display the humidity percentage and cartesian graph and also a bar graph, and maximum and minimum value recorded
### Third version
It's similar to the other version but the graph it is a candlestick graph, so the graph appears continuous

# DHT11 humidity sensor

For this arduino project I used ``DHT-11 Sensor`` and a ``display OLED 128x64 pixel i2c``

The repository includes three file .ino for three version of the project 

<br>

### First version 
It prints on the display the humidity percentage and cartesian graph
### Second version
It prints on the display the humidity percentage and cartesian graph and also an istogram, and maximum and minimum value recorder
### Third version
It's similar to the other version but the graph it's a candlestick graph, so the graph looks continuos

# DHT11 humidity sensor

For this project I used ``DHT-11 Sensor`` and a ``display OLED 128x64 pixel i2c``

The repository includes three file .ino for three version of the project

### First version 
It print on the display the humidity percentage and cartesian graph
### Seconda versione
It print on the display the humidity percentage and cartesian graph and also an istogram, and maximum and minimum value recorder
### Terza versione
It's similar to the other version but the graph it's a candlestick graph, so the graph look continuos
